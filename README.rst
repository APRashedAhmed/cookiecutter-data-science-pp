Apra Data Science Cookiecutter
==============================

An extension of the standard data science cookiecutter template that adds scripts that I've found to be useful for data-oriented projects. 

Links to the main data science cookiecutter:

- `Project Homepage <https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/>`_
- `Github <https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science>`_

Requirements for the Cookiecutter
---------------------------------
- Python >= 3.5
- `Cookiecutter Python package <http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html>`_ >= 1.4.0: This can be installed with pip by or conda depending on how you manage your Python packages: ::

  $ pip install cookiecutter


  or ::

  $ conda install cookiecutter -c conda-forge


Starting a New Project
----------------------

If using for the first time: ::

  $ cookiecutter https://github.com/apra-data-science

Otherwise: ::

  $ cookiecutter apra-data-science


Resulting Directory Structure
-----------------------------

The directory structure of your new project looks like this:
